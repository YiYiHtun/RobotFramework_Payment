## Setup Instructions

1. Update 'BASE_URL'
Set the `${BASE_URL}` variable to the full path of your local HTML file. This is typically done in your `.robot` test file or a shared resource file:

```robot
${BASE_URL}    file:///D:/RobotFramework/ui/payment_ui.html

2. Start the Mock Server
   python mockup_server.py

3. Run the Tests
   robot payment_test.robot
